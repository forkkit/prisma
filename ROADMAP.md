# Roadmap

As we're focusing all of our resources on the development of [Prisma 2](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2), Prisma 1 has been put into [maintenance mode](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/4898). This means that no new features will be developed, but criticial bugs will of course be fixed.

Stay up to date about the timeline for Prisma 2 on the [Prisma blog](https://www.prisma.io/blog) and by [following @prisma on Twitter](https://twitter.com/prisma).
